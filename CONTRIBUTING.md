# How to contribute

Collaboration is one of the things that make open-source so great. To achieve collaboration, we need contributorsâ€”contributors like you. So, thank you for being here!

## Code of conduct

It's very important to me that everyone involved in this project in some way show each other respect and accept each other's differences, whether they are related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, age, race, ethnicity, political affiliation, religion, profession, skill level or any other such attribute. I want everyone to be able to feel that this is a safe space to be. Any abusive or demeaning behaviour will be acted upon.

If you are experiencing problems regarding other people's behaviour within this project, don't hesitate to [e-mail me][contact-email] so I can start working on a solution.

## Check my spelling and grammar

English isn't my native language. There's no doubt that I have made several spelling and grammar mistakes throughout the documents within this project. If you spot one or more of those, or if you have an idea how to make a piece of text more succinct or easier to read, feel free to make a pull request with the corrections you would like to see. If you don't want to do that, or aren't really sure how, you can create an issue instead, where you describe the corrections you would like me to make.
