Hello! :wave:

This is my personal GitHub page. I'm Johan, a computer engineer from Sweden with a love for gaming and accessibility.

While I do most of my programming for my company [JN Programutveckling AB](https://github.com/jn-programutveckling), I work on a number of hobby projects whose code, if open-source, can be found on this personal GitHub.

## Programming languages

My main programming language is Java, but I also use PHP, HTML/CSS, Python and C#. Recently, I've also delved into the wondrous world of JavaScript and specifically Node.js. I have also started working with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) and GDScript.
